This website is for disseminating SDG indicator data for the City of Los Angeles. It is developed by Mayor Garcetti’s Office of International Affairs in collaboration with the City of Los Angeles Information Technology Agency, with support from The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation and The Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles (MFLA). More information about the project and to see the City of Los Angeles Voluntary Local Review, visit our project [website](http://sdg.lamayor.org).

Other cities wishing to reuse this site's underlying platform are welcome to do so for free. The Open SDG [Quickstart](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/) guide highlights key information on how to do this. The [Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE)](http://www.opendataenterprise.org/) can also provide guidance and support through their [SDG National Reporting Initiative](https://www.sdgreporting.org/). Note that this site is currently at an Alpha state, and so is still under development.

If you have any feedback on this website or SDG data then please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>. The answers to some frequently asked questions are also available in our [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq/).
